//! Sensitive-data / privilege-escalation hard-deny ruleset (v1) — the
//! migration target for segments 1-4 of the former bundle hooks
//! `deny_sensitive_paths.sh` / `.ps1`.
//!
//! ## Background: why the hook died
//!
//! Since foundation v0.9.3 the model/execution surface only exposes the `Bash`
//! tool (`exec_shell*` spellings moved into `RETIRED_TOOL_NAMES`), so the
//! ToolCallBefore hook receives the raw model tool name `Bash`. Hook segments
//! 3/4 (DANGEROUS_CMDS / sudo block) gated on `$TOOL == "exec_shell"*` and
//! therefore silently stopped firing (`exit 0` passthrough). Instead of
//! repairing the hook's tool-name matching, the policy moves into the
//! foundation execpolicy rule engine.
//!
//! Segments 1/2 (path/filename substring over the full ARGS of EVERY tool) did
//! keep firing, but full-ARGS substring matching also blocked benign commands
//! (`ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa host`, `cat docs/id_rsa-rotation.md`). This ruleset
//! re-expresses their intent on the token channel: everything the token
//! channel can express without reintroducing that false-positive surface is
//! denied (never narrower than the live hook on those vectors), and every
//! residual gap is registered under "known semantic differences" instead of
//! being silently dropped.
//!
//! ## Why EngineConfig.exec_policy_engine (programmatic injection)
//!
//! The foundation embedder channel `EngineConfig.exec_policy_engine` is the
//! native injection point: the engine evaluates every main-session tool call
//! with token-level + shell-expansion/dequoting matching, and a typed `Deny`
//! short-circuits every approval mode (including YOLO/Never). Evaluation
//! happens after the ToolCallBefore hook and before approval; the two defense
//! lines are independent and either one blocks. Coverage is bounded to
//! main-line sessions: nested subagent tool calls do not pass through this
//! check (the foundation subagent executor does not consult execpolicy yet;
//! see known differences). Precedent in this codebase: `scope_deny_ruleset`
//! (connector/skill gating) uses the same channel.
//!
//! ## Matching semantics (`crates/execpolicy`)
//!
//! - `command` deny rules are promoted into `denied_prefixes`
//!   (deny-always-wins);
//! - `deny_scan_targets` shell-expands commands (strips ~18 wrappers such as
//!   sudo/doas/env/nohup/timeout/xargs, dequotes, splits chained segments and
//!   command substitutions), so a single `command = "sudo"` rule covers
//!   `sudo rm`, `/usr/bin/sudo`, `sudo -u root …`, chained segments, and every
//!   other variant;
//! - `denied_prefix_matches` compares positional tokens: the rule's first
//!   token is basename-folded (`/bin/rm` still matches `rm`), later tokens
//!   must match exactly, flags (and their ambiguous values) are skippable, and
//!   the match hits when the rule tokens are exhausted. A non-flag token that
//!   is not the next rule token ends the match — which is why argument-
//!   position readers such as `grep PATTERN <path>` cannot be expressed here;
//! - rule tool name `exec_shell` matches the `Bash` family (action `run`) and
//!   the retired `exec_shell` spellings via `canonical_action_alias`.
//!
//! ## v1 semantics (intent of former hook segments 1-4)
//!
//! | Former segment | Migrated form |
//! |---|---|
//! | 1. SENSITIVE_DIRS path substring (all tool ARGS) | viewer reads × directory spellings (~, $HOME, ${HOME}, the real home, /root × bare/trailing-slash) + `find <sensitive-dir>` blanket search-root deny + known credential child files |
//! | 2. SENSITIVE_NAMES filename substring | viewer reads × filename spellings in their owning directories |
//! | 3. DANGEROUS_CMDS (was already dead) | viewers × sensitive absolute files + `ssh-keygen` / `gpg --export-secret-keys[-subkeys]` command words |
//! | 4. sudo block while super permission off (was already dead) | `sudo` (+`sudoedit`) command-word deny; rules added/removed per `super_permission::is_enabled()` snapshot |
//! | (live substring write/exfil coverage) | `cp`/`mv`/`scp`/`rsync`/`tar`/`zip`/`ln`/`ditto`/`curl` deny when the FIRST positional (or flag-value) argument is a sensitive path (the exfil direction: sensitive data as copy source), plus `dd if=`/`of=` key-value tokens |
//! | (live substring destroy coverage) | `rm`/`unlink`/`rmdir`/`shred`/`truncate` deny when the FIRST positional argument is a sensitive path (Windows: `del`/`erase`/`remove-item`/`ri`/`rm`/`rd`/`rmdir`/`icacls`/`rename-item`/`rni` + canonical cmd.exe `/`-flag sequences) |
//! | (live substring glob-dump coverage) | viewer/exfil/destroy families include the `…/<dir>/*` glob token per sensitive directory and prefix (`cat ~/.ssh/*`, `type %userprofile%\.ssh\*`) |
//! | (live Windows `.ps1` segments 1/2) | the same read/exfil/destroy families under Windows-native spellings: `%userprofile%\` / `$home\` / `$env:userprofile\` / `~\` prefixes, backslash directory/child/name spellings, the `%appdata%`/`%localappdata%`/`$env:` Microsoft credential & protect directories, and the resolved real home on Windows hosts |
//! | `.ps1` segment-3 credential command words (was already dead) | `cmdkey` / `vaultcmd` / `get-credential` / `get-storedcredential` / credential-manager `control` invocations / `rundll32 keymgr.dll,krshowkeymgr` |
//!
//! Design notes:
//!
//! - Read rules are issued only for read-only viewers (`cat`/`less`/`more`/
//!   `head`/`tail`/`base64`/`xxd`/`od`/`strings`). The former hook's
//!   full-ARGS substring also blocked legitimate uses — using your own SSH
//!   key with `ssh -i` (no `ssh` rules exist), the WRITE path of key
//!   rotation (`cp new_key ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` — exfil/destroy anchor on
//!   the source/first argument only), and editing `~/.ssh/config` on
//!   request; v1 intentionally does not reproduce those false positives.
//!   Read-side config reads (`cat ~/.ssh/config`) remain denied — hook
//!   parity, not a regression.
//! - Exfil rules anchor on the first positional argument because that is the
//!   leak direction (`cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa /tmp/x`); writing INTO a sensitive path
//!   (`cp new_key ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`) stays allowed so key rotation
//!   workflows keep working.
//! - Revived coverage: rules 3 and 4 were silently dead before this migration
//!   and now fire again. The `/etc/sudoers.d/` fragment globs and the
//!   `-`/`.bak` backup spellings of the absolute files (caught by the former
//!   hook's substrings) are spelled out explicitly. Rules 1/2 are never
//!   narrower than the live hook on any vector the token channel can express
//!   under CANONICAL enumeration: cmd.exe `/`-flag sequences are enumerated
//!   in their canonical orders, directory-level glob dump forms (`cat
//!   ~/.ssh/*`) are enumerated, and the combinatorial tails (arbitrary flag
//!   orders, name-level globs, `.exe`-suffixed command spellings) are
//!   registered residues below. One deliberate exception: `touch` on a
//!   sensitive path is no longer denied — it can neither read nor destroy
//!   content, so the former substring denial had zero security value
//!   (registered as a false-positive removal below, pinned on the allow
//!   side).
//!
//! ## Known v1 semantic differences (registered, not silent)
//!
//! - Deliberate false-positive removals (narrower than the former hook on
//!   purpose): the substring also denied commands whose denial has no
//!   security value in this threat model. `touch <sensitive path>` can
//!   neither read nor destroy content, so v1 allows it (allow-trace pinned);
//!   re-adding such a rule requires a deliberate decision.
//! - Sensitive-directory child files are only covered for an enumerated list
//!   of well-known credential files (files whose CONTENT is itself a secret);
//!   the secret-bearing child DIRECTORY `.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d` is
//!   enumerated as a directory (find-root and exfil/destroy first-argument
//!   anchoring), but arbitrary children — its individual key files, anything
//!   under `~/.password-store/` — stay allowed: the token channel has no
//!   directory-containment primitive (argument positions match exact tokens
//!   only). `~/.ssh/known_hosts` is deliberately NOT enumerated: it
//!   holds public host-key material (world-readable by OpenSSH default) and
//!   was never in the former segment-2 explicit name list — it was caught
//!   only by the blanket segment-1 substring.
//! - Argument-position readers cannot be expressed: `grep PATTERN
//!   ~/.kube/config` keeps the sensitive path behind a non-flag positional
//!   token, which ends a denied-prefix match (foundation token-channel limit).
//!   The same limit applies to multi-argument removals (`rm a b` covers only
//!   the first target), Windows `findstr`/`Invoke-WebRequest` readers,
//!   `chmod`/`chown` (mode/owner precedes the path), dest-first archive and
//!   upload forms (`7z a a.7z ~/.ssh`,
//!   `aws s3 cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa s3://…`, `curl --form file=@…`,
//!   `wget --post-file=…` — `zip -r` and `curl -T` ARE anchored via the
//!   engine's flag-value skipping), `dd if=<any> of=<sensitive>` (the
//!   varying `if=` token blocks the prefix match; the reversed `of=`-first
//!   order and the read direction are denied), and concrete sudoers
//!   fragment names (`/etc/sudoers.d/<fragment>` — arbitrary names; the
//!   `…/sudoers.d/*` glob spelling IS denied).
//! - Combinatorial-spelling residues (canonical enumeration only):
//!   cmd.exe flag orders beyond the canonical sequences (`del /s /f /q …` —
//!   the engine skips only `-`-prefixed flags; the foundation could later
//!   teach it `/`-style skipping), name-level globs (`~/.ssh/id_*` — the
//!   specific names are covered and broad globs would over-block public
//!   material like `id_rsa.pub`), `.exe`-suffixed POSIX command spellings
//!   under MSYS/Git-Bash (`cat.exe ~/.ssh/id_rsa` — command-word folding
//!   does not strip `.exe`; only `control.exe` is separately enumerated),
//!   `attrib +h …`-style plus-flag-first forms, the double-quoted
//!   `"${HOME}/…"` spelling (the deny-scan expansion drops the brace form
//!   from the word, leaving a leading-slash token no rule names), sensitive
//!   directories nested at arbitrary depth under the home
//!   (`~/projects/.ssh/id_rsa`), and prefix-agnostic `\microsoft\credentials`
//!   locations outside the enumerated profile prefixes (other drives,
//!   `%systemroot%`).
//! - Absolute paths under OTHER users' homes (`/home/other/.ssh/…`) are not
//!   enumerated; only `~`, `$HOME`, `${HOME}`, the process's real home, and
//!   `/root` are spelled out.
//! - Non-Bash tool surfaces: the former hook substring-matched the ARGS of
//!   EVERY tool (fetch/rlm/tasks/Git/MCP…). v1 keys only on `exec_shell`
//!   (Bash family) commands and File read-family path rules.
//! - `File` tool path rules are limited to workspace-relative paths by the
//!   foundation's workspace normalization; home-absolute File reads generate
//!   no rule (the former hook covered File calls via substring).
//! - Windows-native spellings ARE covered (the former `.ps1` segments 1/2):
//!   `%userprofile%\` / `$home\` / `$env:userprofile\` / `~\` prefixes,
//!   backslash directory/child/name spellings, the `%appdata%`/
//!   `%localappdata%`/`$env:` Microsoft credential & protect directories,
//!   the resolved real home when the host provides a backslash home, and the
//!   revived segment-3 credential command words. Remaining Windows residues:
//!   children of the Microsoft credential directories (generated file
//!   names), mixed- or
//!   forward-separator spellings under the Windows prefixes
//!   (`%userprofile%/.ssh/id_rsa` — the hook's substring matched these
//!   incidentally; enumerating every separator variant would multiply the
//!   Windows families and stays with the ruleset re-review future work),
//!   `cmd /c`-style
//!   nested invocations, other users' profiles (`C:\Users\<other>\…`),
//!   `findstr`/`Invoke-WebRequest`-style argument-position readers, and
//!   double-quoted backslash paths (the foundation deny-scan dequotes with
//!   POSIX semantics, stripping backslashes inside `"…"` — the expanded
//!   token loses its separators; unquoted and single-quoted spellings still
//!   match). Doubled-backslash (JSON-escaped) spellings are NOT a residue:
//!   the deny-scan escape decoding folds `\\` into `\`, so the decoded token
//!   matches the single-backslash rules (probe-verified).
//! - Flag-less BSD-style command forms escape first-argument anchoring:
//!   `tar czf /tmp/a.tgz ~/.ssh` (no leading dash on flags) is allowed.
//! - Editors and unlisted readers (`vi` and other opener tools) are
//!   allowed; the
//!   former hook denied them via substring at the cost of blocking legitimate
//!   `ssh -i`/edit workflows.
//! - `find` with a sensitive directory NOT as the first path token
//!   (`find . ~/.ssh -name x`) escapes the anchored match; leading global
//!   options (`find -L ~/.ssh …`) are covered by flag skipping. General
//!   search roots (`find ~ -name id_rsa`) are future work for the same
//!   arg-position reason as grep.
//! - Heredoc / multi-line command bodies can over-block: the foundation's
//!   segment scan splits on real newlines and prefers over-blocking; a script
//!   containing a literal `cat /etc/shadow` line is hard-denied (inherent
//!   foundation deny-scan behavior, live again now that rule 3 exists).
//! - Rule 4 is a snapshot taken when the ruleset is built: mid-session
//!   super-permission toggles hot-refresh via `set_super_permission` →
//!   `refresh_permission_rulesets`, same as the existing scope rules. The
//!   toggle command is not serialized, so rapid concurrent toggles have a
//!   narrow stale-snapshot window; the next rebuild/engine restart after the
//!   final disk write is authoritative.
//! - Nested subagent tool calls do not pass through execpolicy (see above);
//!   under YOLO subagents are not bound by these rules — to be closed when
//!   the foundation wires the subagent executor to execpolicy. The former
//!   ToolCallBefore hook did not fire for nested subagent tool calls either
//!   (hooks execute on the main-line turn loop only; the subagent registry
//!   dispatches tools directly), so this is a pre-existing coverage boundary
//!   shared with main, not a regression introduced by this migration.
