# Software Bill of Materials

Pinvou Agent uses GitHub's dependency graph to maintain a live SPDX 2.3 Software
Bill of Materials (SBOM) for the public repository.

## Export the current source SBOM

From a GitHub CLI session with read access to the public repository:

```bash
gh api repos/Pinvou/pinvou-agent/dependency-graph/sbom \
  > pinvou-agent.spdx.json
```

The same dependency inventory is available from the repository's
[Dependency graph](https://github.com/Pinvou/pinvou-agent/network/dependencies).

The generated document covers dependencies detected from committed manifests
and lockfiles. Directly redistributed scripts, Skills, connectors, and assets
that need additional attribution are recorded in
[`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) and in notices stored next
to their resources.

Release-specific packages may add platform files or privately built Official
components. Release-level SBOMs are handled by the manual release process:
`release-packages.yml` only produces the installers and their sha256 checksums
and does not create a GitHub Release. When publishing a release by hand, attach
or reference an SBOM for the exact released artifacts, and do not describe an
Official package as reproducible from the Community source tree.
