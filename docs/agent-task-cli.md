# Headless agentic single-task CLI (`pinvou agent run`)

`pinvou agent run` executes **one product-equivalent agentic turn** inside a windowed Tauri host: the same send path as GUI chat (Yolo mode, product tool allowlist, real Bash / File (write/edit) / Git / Web execution), with the session execution root bound to a caller-provided task directory. It targets external benchmark harnesses (Terminal-Bench/Harbor) that install Pinvou Agent into a task container to perform real terminal work. It does not go through the eval backend (`HeadlessAgentBackend`) and never touches any eval tool policy — the read-only isolation semantics of GAIA-style evaluation are unaffected.

Relationship with `pinvou benchmark ...`: the benchmark subcommand family runs batch evaluation over fixed datasets, with a read-only tool policy and a privacy output pipeline; `agent run` performs full agentic execution of a single task instruction and returns its output (assistant text, tool events, usage) directly to the caller. Both share the same windowless host bootstrap.

## Build and run

```bash
cargo build --manifest-path pinvou-cli/Cargo.toml --bin pinvou
PINVOU3_HOME=/path/to/sandbox pinvou agent run \
    --prompt-file task.txt \
    --workspace /path/to/task-dir \
    --timeout-secs 600 \
    --output json
```

- `--prompt-file` (required): task instruction file; its content enters the product send path verbatim, without any eval envelope.
- `--workspace` (optional): task working directory. When provided, the directory must already exist; it is canonicalized to an absolute path and becomes the engine cwd and the shell execution directory (same mechanism as the project binding of native code sessions; the `ExecutionRootResolver` only applies to the session generated for this run). When omitted, a session-private directory is used (the same isolated scratch as eval sessions).
- `--timeout-secs` (default 600, capped at 604800 = 7 days): task timeout. The deadline covers the whole task, including session prepare/submit — a hang in either phase still produces a `timeout` report instead of hanging forever. On timeout the turn is cancelled first; if it has not settled within the 30s settle window, the report is emitted immediately and the process never waits unboundedly. The cap is enforced at parse time — an unbounded `u64` would overflow the internal `Instant + Duration` and panic; the library clamps to the same cap (`MAX_TIMEOUT_SECS`) for direct API callers.
- `--output human|json`: `human` prints a session/status line plus the assistant text; `json` prints the full report as a single-line JSON.
- `PINVOU3_AGENT_TASK_KEEP_SESSION=1`: skip the post-turn session cleanup so the session artifacts (full timeline/transcript) stay under `$PINVOU3_HOME/sessions/<session_id>` for harness-side debugging. By default the temporary session is deleted once the report has been produced.

Prerequisites: the `settings.json` of the sandbox `PINVOU3_HOME` needs an active model (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works, `preset = "openai_compatible"`); `PINVOU3_ALLOW_SHELL=1` pins shell authorization without relying on prefs. benchmark-hooks builds pin the per-turn tool-call cap to 8 (the GAIA runaway guard), so long-horizon agentic tasks must raise it explicitly, e.g. `PINVOU3_MAX_TOOL_CALLS=512`. The knob is process-wide — it also applies to GAIA runs in the same process, so scope the environment to one run kind per container. Invalid values (including `0`, which would disable every tool call) are reported on stderr and fall back to the default cap of 8.

## Output contract

JSON report fields: `session_id`, `status` (`Completed`/`Failed`/`timeout`/`error` or another engine status), `timed_out`, `completed_after_deadline` (timeout race marker: a turn that finished naturally after the deadline but before the cancel took effect keeps the engine's real `status` instead of being rewritten to `timeout`, letting graders distinguish "finished, but past the line" from "cancelled"; absent in older reports, defaults to false), `assistant_text` (last turn's assistant text), `tool_events` (tool names and success flags only, never arguments/results), `usage` (input/output/cache hit/cache miss/cache write/reasoning tokens and context window), `error` (host-side root causes — populated on `status=error` reports and on `timeout` reports whose session setup did not finish in time, whose cancel did not settle, or whose final turn-result read failed after the deadline fired — as well as the engine's own failure message for failed turns). Tool events deliberately carry no payloads, so reports can safely be persisted under `/logs` for harness usage aggregation. While the turn runs, a liveness heartbeat is written to stderr every 10 seconds; stdout stays reserved for the final report.

Exit codes: whenever a report is produced (including `timeout`/`error` statuses) the process exits 0 — in-turn failures are settled by the harness grader from the report, while a non-zero exit would make timed-out tasks count as exceptions instead of zero-reward runs and skew the mean. Non-zero exit codes are reserved for host-level failures (unreadable `--prompt-file`, missing or non-directory `--workspace`, unusable backend, ...); argument errors (missing `--prompt-file`, out-of-range `--timeout-secs`, ...) exit 2.

## Running inside a container (Terminal-Bench shape)

The binary is a dynamically linked Tauri program; task containers need the GTK3/WebKit2GTK 4.1 runtimes and xvfb (the windowed event loop still requires an X server without a display):

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y \
    libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0 libgtk-3-0 libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1-0 \
    libayatana-appindicator3-1 xvfb xauth ca-certificates procps curl
```

Run as `xvfb-run -a pinvou agent run ...`. The model endpoint must be reachable from inside the container (docker bridge gateway, e.g. `http://172.17.0.1:13000/v1`). Mind glibc forward compatibility: a binary compiled on an older distro baseline (e.g. Debian bookworm) runs on newer baselines, not the other way around.

## Implementation location

- `pinvou3-app/src-tauri/src/features/assistant/product_runtime/agentic_task.rs`: host bootstrap, execution root binding, turn driving, and the timeout watchdog.
- `pinvou-cli/crates/pinvou-product-backend`: the public `run_agentic_task` launcher.
- `pinvou-cli/crates/cli/src/lib.rs`: `agent run` argument parsing and output rendering.
